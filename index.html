              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
              thereafteer. the next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling -
              time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
              switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

              "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
              Ineeded some sructure from professionals who ca help me learn
              programaming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a formr
              student of their who can only say wonderful things about the
              program.The entire Curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, eas outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I've often referred to it dring interviews as an
              example of my developent experience. It centainly helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offset.
              100% recomend!."
